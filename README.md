# :chess_pawn: Software Engineering Project - Group 24
## :left_speech_bubble: An Overview of Project 17
**Meet MiTCh (Microsoft Trinity Chess), a chess engine created by Group 24 in collaboration with Microsoft!** MiTCh started off as a simple Python-based game of chess, and was later trained using data on real-life chess games. We used decision rules commonly used by video game AIs to assist MiTCh in evaluating the next best moves. 

# 	:robot: Setting up MiTCh
## 	:computer: Getting MiTCh on your Machine
**Option 1: Docker**
* Download our Docker Image with ```docker pull brandonpaisley/project17_chessengine:v```
* Run the image with `docker run brandonpaisley/project17_chessengine:v`
* Open your browser on Localhost:4200

**Option 2: Local**
* Run our backend first in the background with `flask --app backend/static/app.py &`
* Run our frontend with `ng serve`
* Open your broswer on localhost:4200

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.0 :)

## :gear: Running a Development Server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## :wrench: Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## :shield: Building the Project
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## :screwdriver: Running Project Tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## :hammer: Running End-to-End Tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## 	:question: Additional Help
To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.


#	:dizzy: About the Project
## :mantelpiece_clock: Project Development

We used **Agile Development metholodgies** to guide the growth of our project. The Project was developed over 4 Sprint periods, during which we focused on Research, Creating a Chess Game, Implementing Health Changes, and introducing Machine Learning. This involved a lot of communication and collaboration within the team, as well as with our clients & demonstrator!

We were very proud to have pitched the project at the annual **SwEng Industry Awards as 1 of 10 shortlisted teams**. A poster and demo video were created in order to promote our project to the audience. **We were even more proud to learn that we were 1 of 3 runner-up teams!**
